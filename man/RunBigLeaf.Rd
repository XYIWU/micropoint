\arguments{
\item{weather}{a data.frame of hourly weather as in the example dataset `climdata`}

\item{vegp}{an object of class vegparams formatted as for the inbuilt example dataset `vegparams`}

\item{groundp}{an object of class vegparams formatted as for the inbuilt example dataset `groundparams`}

\item{soilm}{a vector of volumetric soil moisture fractions in the top 10 cm of soil.}

\item{lat}{latitude (decimal degrees). Negative south of the equator.}

\item{long}{longitude (decimal degrees). Negative west of the Greenwich Meridian.}

\item{dTmx}{maximum by which vegetation or soil surface temperature can exceed air temperature (deg C, set to ensure model convergence)}

\item{zref}{height above ground of measurements in `weather` (see details)}

\item{merid}{Longitude of local time zone meridian (decimnal degrees), Default: 0 (Greenwich Mean Time)}

\item{dst}{Daylight saving hours. E.g. with `merid = 0` 0 for UTC or 1  for British Summer Time.}

\item{maxiter}{Maximum number of iterations over which to run the model}

\item{bwgt}{backward weighting to apply when iteratively running the model (default 0.5)}

\item{tol}{Error margin (deg C) deemed acceptable for model convergence (default 0.5).}

\item{gmn}{optional minimum convective conductance value (mol/m^2/s). Lower values are more
physically realistic, but can reduce likelihood of model convergence.}

\item{plotout}{optional logical indicating whether to plot a time-series of ground surface
temperatures on each iteration}

\item{swmethod}{method used to calculate fraction of ground surface acting as free water surface
(0 = based on rainfall, 1 computed from soil effective relative humidity, 2 computed from soil moisture fraction)}

\item{yearG}{optional logical indicating whether or not to calculate and account for annual ground heat flux cycle}
}
\value{
an object of class pointmicro, namely a list of the following:
\describe{
 \item{tme}{POSIXlt object of times and dates corresponding to model outputs}
 \item{Tc}{a vector of canopy heat exchange surface temperatures (deg C)}
 \item{Tg}{a vector of ground surface temperatures (deg C)}
 \item{H}{a vector of sensible heat fluxes (W/m^2)}
 \item{G}{a vector of ground heat fluxes (W/m^2)}
 \item{psih}{diabatic correction factors for heat}
 \item{psim}{diabatic correction factors for momentum}
 \item{phih}{diabatic influencing factors for heat}
 \item{OL}{Obukhov length}
 \item{error.mar}{maximum temperature difference between ultimate and penultimate iteration of model}
}
}
\description{
Runs big leaf model iteratively to derive ground and canopy
heat exchange surface temperatures
}
\details{
When running the model `zref` must be greater than he height of vegetation.
If running for a location with tall vegetation, function [WeatherHeight()] can
be used to adjust e.g. temperature and wind speed to a user-specified height.
